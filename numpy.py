#In this code we learn about Numpy in Python.
"""Python list are slow for large numerical data.
Numpy gives: 
1. Fast computation C-backed.
2.Multi dimensional arrays.
3. Mathematical & Linear algebra power.
4. Backbone of Pandas, Tensorflow,PyTorch.

If you want to use NumPy in your System then you have to first install Numpy in your System.
You have to first open your terminal then use some basic commands to install it.
1. pip install numpy
2. import numpy as np

And if you want to check that weather you successfully installed numpy or not then use:
import numpy
print(numpy.__version__)
If something appears like: 2.4.0 or any kind of other decimal digits then it means NumPy successfully installed in your PC.
