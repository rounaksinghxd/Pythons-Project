#In this code we learn about Numpy in Python.
#Python list are slow for large numerical data.
#Numpy gives: 1. Fast computation C-backed,, 2.Multi dimensional arrays,,
#3. Mathematical & Linear algebra power,, 4. Backbone of Pandas, Tensorflow,PyTorch.

#If we want to use NumPy in our System then we have to first install Numpy in our System.
#We have to first open our terminal then use some basic command to install.
# 1. pip install numpy
# 2. import numpy as np
# We sucessfully installed NumPy in our System.
